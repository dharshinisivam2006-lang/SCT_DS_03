Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier
Objective

To build a Decision Tree Classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase a bank product based on demographic and behavioral data.

Dataset

Dataset Name: Bank Marketing Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
File Used: bank-additional-full.csv

Tools and Technologies

Python
Google Colab
Pandas
Scikit-learn

Methodology

Downloaded the Bank Marketing dataset from Kaggle.
Uploaded the CSV file to Google Colab.
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Converted categorical variables into numerical values using Label Encoding.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier model.
Evaluated the model using accuracy score.

Model Used

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Target Variable: y (Customer subscription: Yes / No)
Results
The Decision Tree model successfully predicted whether a customer would subscribe to the bank product with good accuracy.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Decision Tree Classifier can be used effectively for customer purchase prediction using marketing data.
