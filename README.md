Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier
Objective

Objective
To build a Decision Tree Classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase a bank product using the Bank Marketing dataset.
Dataset
Dataset Name: Bank Marketing Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
File Used: bank-additional-full.csv
Tools & Technologies
Google Colab
Python
Libraries Used:
pandas
scikit-learn
Methodology
The dataset was downloaded and uploaded to Google Colab.
The CSV file was loaded using pandas.
Categorical features were converted into numerical values using Label Encoding.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree Classifier was trained on the training data.
The model performance was evaluated using accuracy score.
Model
Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Target Variable: y (Customer subscription: Yes / No)
Result
The Decision Tree model achieved good accuracy in predicting whether a customer will subscribe to the bank product.
Conclusion
This project shows that a Decision Tree Classifier can be effectively used for customer behavior prediction in bank marketing data after proper preprocessing.
